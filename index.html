                    Tere Naam (transl.â€‰In your name) is a 2003 Indian Hindi-language romantic tragedy film directed by Satish Kaushik. Written by Bala and Jainendra Jain, the film stars Salman Khan and Bhumika Chawla in her Hindi film debut.[2] It is a remake of Bala's own Tamil film Sethu (1999) featured Vikram in the lead role.[3]

The film was based on a real-life incident of a friend of Bala's, who had fallen in love, lost his mind and ended up at a mental asylum.[4][5] Tere Naam was released on 15 August 2003 and became a moderate box-office success, although its soundtrack album was a blockbuster. Khan was praised for his portrayal of Radhe Mohan and the role is widely considered to be his best performance till date.
